# The Riven tBMP bitmap format, as detailed at
# http://www.dalcanton.it/tito/esperimenti/riven/tbmp.html, can contain 8- or
# 24-bit images, optionally compressed in a proprietary algorithm.
# contains inline Metadata on what data an archive contains, and where. Since
# this information is unlikely to change often (if at all), it is useful to
# cache it when first gathered.
# This also especially helps with the 5-CD-ROM version, where four out of five
# media (and thus, their archive Metadata) are typically offline.

# TODO: For now, 8-bit is assumed.
